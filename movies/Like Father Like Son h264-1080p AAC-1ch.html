        <td class="plot">Luis Preciado is a brilliant Mexican trumpet player who has recently hit a patch of bad luck. If he can't find a job as a musician, a requirement of his O-1 visa, he'll be forced to return to Mexico. His luck takes a turn when he runs into, his ex-girlfriend and the mother of his son, Juanito, whom he hasn't seen in over 10 years. Luis learns that Juanito, a high school freshmen, is playing trumpet in his school's marching band. Luis secretly attends the marching band practice and discovers that, because of district budget cuts, the band currently lacks a director. Luis applies for the job and gets it but neglects to inform the school's principal or his estranged son of his real identity. The tension boils over when his ex, Juanito's mother, finds out what Luis is up to and confronts him, threatening to expose his lie. Luis faces another obstacle when he meets with his immigration lawyer who is not convinced that being the director of a high school marching band will satisfy the requirement of his visa, which is specifically for exceptional artists performing at the highest professional level. Luis lies and says that his marching band will be performing at the Tournament of Roses Parade on New Year's Day, an event seen by 70 million people worldwide. Luis sets out to whip the student into shape before the Rose Parade tryouts all while hiding the truth from his son and his ex wife. Equal parts touching and hilarious, &quot;Marching Banda&quot; is the story of a man learning that, though his God given talents may not win him fame and fortune, if he's lucky, they might just give win him back the family he was always meant to have.</td>
