        <td class="plot">When National Geographic photographer James Balog asked, &ldquo;How can one take a picture of climate change?&rdquo; his attention was immediately drawn to ice. Soon he was asked to do a cover story on glaciers that became the most popular and well-read piece in the magazine during the last five years. But for Balog, that story marked the beginning of a much larger and longer-term project that would reach epic proportions.</td>
